# Emotional-Mental-state-classification-using-NLP
Built an NLP-based model to classify emotional and mental states from text using deep learning. Implemented and compared models (Logistic Regression, LSTM, GRU), achieving 78% accuracy with a 4-layer GRU. Used sentence transformers for embeddings and deployed the model via Google Studio.
